#Downloading images from the web#
use a .txt files to reference images hosted around the web
the txt file is then imported via the gui using a wizard.
the txt file is loaded into the program and assigned to an array of strings
user then chooses download location for the files (note user should be aware that they must not change images location after this point)
the save location the user chooses is stored in the program and referenced when pulling the images for the desktop backgroundd
